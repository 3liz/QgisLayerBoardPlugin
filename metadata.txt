description=View and edit vector and raster properties for the project layers in a table
about=This plugin helps to see and modify properties for vector and raster layers. It shows the layers in a table sheet, and the user can directly modify some properties such as layer name, title, abstract, minimum and maximum scales. Some actions can be performed on multiple layers at once, such as modifying spatial reference system and scale based visibility. The layers information can be exported to Comma Separated Values (CSV).
