# Layer Board Plugin


## Description

This plugin helps to see and modify properties for vector and raster layers.


### See and edit layers properties


The plugin shows the list of layers in a table sheet, and the user can directly modify some properties such as layer name, title, abstract, minimum and maximum scales.

To do so, double-click on a cell and modify the value. The modified cells are then drawn in yellow, and you can apply or discard the changes via the button under the table.


### Change a property for multiple layers

Some properties can be changed on multiple layers at once, such as modifying spatial reference system and scale based visibility. To do so, select one or more layers in the vector or raster table, and use the right panel tools in the "Actions on Layers" tab, such as CRS or Max Scale, the click on the corresponding "Set" button. At present, the following properties can be changed for the selected layers:
* *Coordinate Reference System*
* *Max Scale*
* *Min Scale*
* *Encoding*


### Perform actions on multiple layers

Some actions can be performed on multiple layers at once:
* *create a spatial index* , which is done only on vector layers
* *save current style as default* : it creates a QML file beside the source file
* *remove selected layers* from the project


### Perform actions on project level

Global actions can also be performed in the project:
* *Remove ghost layers* : Ghost layers are layers wich are not in QGIS legend, but still have a reference in the XML project file.


### Layer style panel


When only one layers is selected, the tab "Layer style" in the right panel displays the current layers style, and you can change the style directly for the selected layer via the "Apply" button.
This is only available for vector layers.

### Export layers information


The information visible in the "Vector layers" or "Raster layers" tabs can be exported to a "Comma Separated Values" (CSV) text file via the button in the tab "Export" of the right panel


## Notes

**IMPORTANT** : the changes are made in the current project, and will be saved only if you save the project.
